// Authentication scheme to be used for teams. The following methods

// IPADDRESS
//   Use the computer's IP address to authenticate a team. This
//   removes the hassle of logging in with user/pass, but requires
//   that each team has a unique, fixed IP address, that cannot be
//   spoofed, e.g. by logging in on another team's computer.
// PHP_SESSIONS
//   Use PHP sessions with user/password authentication. This allows
//   teams to login from different machines and might be useful for
//   online contests or programming courses.
// FIXED
//   Use one fixed team user that is automatically logged in. This
//   can be useful e.g. for a demo or testing environment. Define
//   FIXED_TEAM to the team user to be used, e.g.:
//   define('FIXED_TEAM', 'domjudge');

// submission of teams that have their address unset. Otherwise these
