Everything in this directory is not part of the core of DOMjudge; it
is not required for DOMjudge to function, but these are add-ons and
other programs, etc. which might be useful when using DOMjudge and
included in the distribution for that reason.

A short description of the contents of this directory follows. Note
that these programs might not be completely uptodate with the DOMjudge
core, so some manual hacking might be necessary to use these.


* checkinput checkinput.awk fixinput.awk

The 'checkinput' programs are meant to check testdata input (and
optionally also output). There's both a C program and AWK script which
do essentially the same thing. See 'checkinput.c' for details. All
scripts take a testdata file as argument. The 'fixinput.awk' script
corrects some problems, that these programs check for, e.g. trailing
whitespace.

* checktestdata

This program can be used as a more advanced replacement of checkinput.
It allows you to not only check on simple (spacing) layout errors, but
a simple grammar file must be specified for the testdata, according to
which the testdata is checked. See 'checktestdata.cpp' for a grammar
specification and files in the 'tests' subdirectory for some examples.

Two sample scripts 'checktestdata.{hello,fltcmp}' are provided for the
sample problems 'hello' and 'fltcmp'.
