This is the Programming Contest Jury System "DOMjudge" version 3.1.3

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the
ACM ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.


Documentation
-------------

For more information on installation and requirements see the
documentation under the doc/admin directory. There are HTML and PDF
versions of the documentation available, prebuilt from SGML sources.

The doc/ directory also contains documentation for users of DOMjudge,
namely for jury members (under doc/judge) and teams (under doc/team).

The jury documentation is also available in HTML and PDF format.

The team documentation is available prebuilt in PDF format, but it
contains default/example settings. To include the correct settings for
your local environment, DOMjudge has to be properly configured first,
as parts of the configuration are used in it (e.g. the URL to the team
interface of DOMjudge). A LaTeX installation including the packages
`svn` and `expdlist` is required to rebuild the team documentation.
For more information, see the administrator documentation.

All documentation is also available online at the DOMjudge homepage:

Please note that this documentation is from the daily generated
snapshot and thus might not apply to your version.
