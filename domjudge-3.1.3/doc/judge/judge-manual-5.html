<P>Once the contest is over, the system will still accept submissions but
will not judge them anymore. Teams will see this as a `TOO-LATE'
response.</P>

<P>If the scoreboard was frozen, it will remain frozen until the time set
as unfreeze time, as seen under Contests. It is possible to publish
the final standings at any given moment by pressing the `unfreeze
scoreboard now' button under contests.</P>

<P>There's not much more to be done after the contest has ended. The
administrator will need to take care of backing up all system data and
submissions, and the awards ceremony can start.</P>
