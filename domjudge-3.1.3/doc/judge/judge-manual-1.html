<P>DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the ACM
ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.</P>
<P>This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 6-10).
Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed
languages, that reads input according to the problem input
specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.</P>
<P>The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to
the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the
program and compares the program output with the expected output.</P>
<P>This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during
such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication
on problems (clarification requests). It has web-interfaces for the
jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the
public (scoreboard).</P>
