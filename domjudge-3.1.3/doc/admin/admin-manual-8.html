<P>This manual assumed you are running a singe-site contest; that is, the teams
are located closely together, probably in a single physical location. In a
multi-site or distributed contest, teams from several remote locations use the
same DOMjudge installation. An example is a national contest where teams can
participate at their local institution.</P>
<P>DOMjudge supports such a setup on the condition that a central installation of
DOMjudge is used to which the teams connect over the internet. It is here where
all submission processing and judging takes place. Because DOMjudge uses a web
interface for all interactions, teams and judges will interface with the system
just as if it were local.  Still, there are some specific considerations for a
multi-site contest.</P>
<P>Network: there must be a relatively reliable network connection between the
locations and the central DOMjudge installation, because teams cannot submit or
query the scoreboard if the network is down. Because of travelling an unsecured
network, you may want to consider HTTPS for encrypting the traffic.  If you
want to limit internet access, it must be done in such a way that the remote
DOMjudge installation can still be reached.</P>
<P>Team authentication: the IP-based authentication will still work as long as
each team workstation has a different public IP address. If some teams are
behind a NAT-router and thus all present themselves to DOMjudge with the same
IP-address, the PHP sessions authentication scheme needs to be used.</P>
<P>Judges: if the people reviewing the submissions will be located remotely as
well, it's important to agree beforehand on who-does-what, using the
submissions claim feature and how responding to incoming clarification requests
is handled. Having a shared chat/IM channel may help when unexpected issues
arise.</P>
<P>Scoreboard: by default DOMjudge presents all teams in the same scoreboard.
Per-site rankings are not currently possible. </P>
