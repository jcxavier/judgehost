DOMjudge team manuals
---------------------

The manuals for teams automatically incorporate DOMjudge configuration
items. Therefore they are not pre-built, but should be built after you
have configured your system, so teams get the correct information. The
manuals can be generated with the 'genteammanuals' command located
under the 'team' subdirectory. Pass the output directory as argument.

As many things are configurable, we advise to redact the manuals to your
specific situation, e.g. by removing unused/disabled features, before
distributing them to the teams. See section 2.16 of the admin-manual for
instructions on rebuilding the team documentation.

The manuals are available both in an English and Dutch version. We welcome
translations into other languages as long as they follow the complete
original English version.
